# Timer_V1
This is Simple Timer (Version 1). A simple timer coded using C++ that runs for infinite amount of time. 

(I pasted the code on a .txt file, feel free to use any code editor to run the timer)

Let me know if you have any question or see an issue, I will try my best to get back to you asap.
